# Chunk C6: Rate-limit Scheduler Implementation

## üéØ Objective
Implement an intelligent rate-limit scheduler to support high-frequency data collection (every 30s) while respecting API limits and managing multiple scraping backends efficiently.

## üìã Requirements

### 1. Smart Rate Limiting
- **Per-backend rate limits** - Different limits for snscrape vs Nitter
- **Dynamic adjustment** - Adapt to backend performance
- **Request queuing** - Queue requests during rate limit periods
- **Priority scheduling** - Important targets get priority

### 2. High-Frequency Collection Support
- **30-second intervals** - Continuous data collection
- **Batch optimization** - Group requests efficiently
- **Memory management** - Handle high-volume data streams
- **Error recovery** - Graceful handling of failures

### 3. Backend Coordination
- **Load balancing** - Distribute requests across backends
- **Health monitoring** - Track backend availability
- **Adaptive switching** - Switch backends based on performance
- **Failure isolation** - Don't let one backend affect others

### 4. Monitoring & Analytics
- **Rate limit tracking** - Monitor usage vs limits
- **Performance metrics** - Response times, success rates
- **Bottleneck detection** - Identify limiting factors
- **Usage optimization** - Suggest configuration improvements

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Rate Limit Core
1. `RateLimitScheduler` class - Core scheduling logic
2. `BackendQuota` system - Per-backend limit tracking
3. `RequestQueue` - Priority-based request queuing
4. Basic rate limiting algorithms

### Phase 2: High-Frequency Support
1. `ContinuousCollector` - 30s interval support
2. `BatchOptimizer` - Request grouping logic
3. `MemoryManager` - Efficient data handling
4. Stream processing integration

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. `LoadBalancer` - Smart backend distribution
2. `HealthMonitor` - Backend status tracking
3. `AdaptiveScheduler` - Dynamic rate adjustment
4. Performance analytics

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
1. Integration with existing AsyncBatchScraper
2. Comprehensive test suite
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Documentation and examples
